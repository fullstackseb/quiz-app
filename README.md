# Quiz App

This is a simple application which lets users answer random questions. The user can see how well he/she did at the end of the quiz and how many questions have been answered correct. Currently, the questions come from a JSON Object and will be replaced by an API shortly.

The page is hosted on Github pages and can be [accessed here](https://sensino-seb.github.io/quiz-app/).
